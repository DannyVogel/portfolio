# Using Claude Desktop with GitHub MCP for Digital Garden Content

Claude Desktop with GitHub's Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provides the ability to seemlessly generate content and upload content by providing the AI model with direct repository access. Based on user input, the AI model can generate the markdown content, with relevant frontmatter headers, tags and any desired styling, and then proceed to directly upload it to the repository via pull request.

## What is Model Context Protocol?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows AI models to connect to apps and data sources in a consistent way, providing the AI model the ability to interact with various tools. Examples include:

- Direct file access and manipulation (desktop files or google drive)
- Github repository access and management
- Controlling Blender or other 3D applications
- Automating tasks in Excel or Google Sheets
- Pulling design specs from Figma and generating code

## Setting Up Claude Desktop to use pre-built MCP servers

## Content Workflow for Nuxt Digital Gardens

The ideal workflow leverages Nuxt Content's strengths:

```vue
<script setup>
// Access dynamic content in your Nuxt components
const { data: aiGeneratedContent } = await queryCollection("/ai").find();
</script>
```

### Creation Process

1. **Ideation**: Provide Claude with a topic or outline
2. **Repository Analysis**: Claude examines existing content structure
3. **Draft Generation**: Get a markdown draft with appropriate frontmatter
4. **Review and Refinement**: Modify the draft as needed
5. **Commit and PR**: Claude can create a branch and PR directly

## Cross-Linking with Existing Content

Claude can analyze your repository to create meaningful connections. The AI identifies related content and creates appropriate wiki-style links, enhancing your digital garden's interconnectedness.

## Frontmatter Consistency

Claude maintains consistent frontmatter structure:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Article Title"
description: "Article description"
date: 2025-04-05
tags: ["nuxt", "content", "ai"]
status: "seedling" # Digital garden growth stage
toc: true
---
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific in prompts**: Give Claude clear direction on topic, scope and target audience.
2. **Review all generated links**: Verify that cross-references actually exist.
3. **Use consistent terminology**: Help Claude understand your personal knowledge taxonomy.
4. **Leverage tags for organization**: Keep tags consistent across related content.
5. **Review and refine**: AI is not perfect, and errors or misrepresentations will need to be corrected.
6. **Limit Github access**: When generating the personal access token, limit the scope and permissions to only those needed to limit the risk of any unintended access and modifications.
