# Using Claude Desktop with GitHub MCP for Digital Garden Content

Claude Desktop with GitHub's Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provides a powerful workflow for creating and managing content for Nuxt-based digital gardens. This approach combines AI assistance with direct repository access, streamlining the content creation process.

## What is Model Context Protocol?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is GitHub's framework that enables AI models like Claude to interact directly with repositories through a standardized API. It provides:

- Direct file access and manipulation
- Repository search capabilities
- Branch and PR management
- Content generation with repository awareness

For digital garden maintainers, this means Claude can understand your content structure and assist with organization while maintaining consistent linking between articles.

## Setting Up Claude Desktop with GitHub MCP

1. Install Claude Desktop application
2. Enable developer tools in Claude settings
3. Connect Claude to your GitHub account
4. Grant repository permissions to the MCP server
5. Start creating content with repository awareness

## Content Workflow for Nuxt Digital Gardens

The ideal workflow leverages Nuxt Content's strengths:

```vue
<script setup>
// Access dynamic content in your Nuxt components
const { data: aiGeneratedContent } = await queryContent('/ai').find()
</script>
```

### Creation Process

1. **Ideation**: Provide Claude with a topic or outline
2. **Repository Analysis**: Claude examines existing content structure
3. **Draft Generation**: Get a markdown draft with appropriate frontmatter
4. **Review and Refinement**: Modify the draft as needed
5. **Commit and PR**: Claude can create a branch and PR directly

## Cross-Linking with Existing Content

Claude can analyze your repository to create meaningful connections:

```markdown

```

The AI identifies related content and creates appropriate wiki-style links, enhancing your digital garden's interconnectedness.

## Frontmatter Consistency

Claude maintains consistent frontmatter structure:

```yaml

title: "Your Article Title"
description: "Article description"
date: 2025-04-05
tags: ["nuxt", "content", "ai"]
status: "seedling" # Digital garden growth stage
toc: true
---
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific in prompts**: Give Claude clear direction on topic, scope and target audience
2. **Review all generated links**: Verify that cross-references actually exist
3. **Use consistent terminology**: Help Claude understand your personal knowledge taxonomy
4. **Start branches with purpose-oriented names**: Use prefixes like `content/` or `feature/`
5. **Leverage tags for organization**: Keep tags consistent across related content

## Limitations and Considerations

- Claude works best with plain markdown and may struggle with custom Vue components in markdown
- Repository permissions should be carefully managed
- Large repositories may take longer to analyze
- Always review AI-generated content for accuracy
