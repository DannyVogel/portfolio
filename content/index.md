# Welcome to Danny's Digital Garden

This space is a growing repository of my notes, thoughts and ideas related to software development and beyond, with a focus on full-stack web applications and the tools and techniques that go into building them.

While my journey began as a frontend developer, I've since expanded my skills and am capable of writing full-stack applications, with ever-increasing knowledge of backend development, DevOps, security, LLMs/AI, and more.

I've learned a lot from the internet and I'm hoping to give back by sharing my knowledge, while also keeping track of the things I've learned and discovering the connections between seemingly disparate topics.

Explore the garden by clicking on the article links in the sidebar. Take a look at [this article](/garden/ai/claude-github-mcp) to read about my workflow for creating articles for the garden.
